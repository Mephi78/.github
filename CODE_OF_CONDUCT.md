# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors and leaders from around the globe pledge to make  
participation in our community a pleasant and personal growth supporting experience  
for Every Human Being, regardless of their skills, personalities and preferences.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that create a welcoming and healthy atmosphere.

## Our Guidelines

To grow a positive environment for the success of our community...

...we show empathy and kindness towards each other  
...we treat also differing opinions, viewpoints or experiences with respect  
...we give and gracefully accept constructive feedback  
...we live responsibility and take mistakes as an opportunity to learn  
...we focus on our common goals and needs, rather than individual wants  

## Our Responsibilities

Each community member and guest is responsible for their own actions and is encouraged  
to report inappropriate behavior or content by addressing `@Mephi78` or labeling `admin`.

Any complaint will be reviewed and investigated fairly, in a timely manner and by  
respecting the privacy and security of the incident reporter.

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of  
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response  
to any behavior they deem inappropriate.

Therefore community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit or  
reject any kind of contribution that is not aligned to this Code of Conduct and  
will communicate their moderation decisions appropriately.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also when an  
individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct was inspired by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org).
